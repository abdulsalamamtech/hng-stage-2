## The Project

On this week HNG project I built a Laravel RESTful Country Currency & Exchange API that fetches country data from an external API, stores it in a database, and provides CRUD operations.

This task validates my ability to work with dynamic external APIs.

I started by installing new Laravel aaplication.

Creating the migration file, model, controller, and route endpoint.

Then creating country service class to separate the main logic to simplify the controller.

Then I created the seeder class to seed the database with real external api data and more...

I created a repository and push the project.

I deploy the project to railway.

Then I test the project to see how it works.

Thanks.

-   Live endpoint: https://hngi13-backend-task-production.up.railway.app/api/countries

## Run the project locally

```sh
    # clone the project
    git clone https://github.com/abdulsalamamtech/hng-stage-1

    # cd into the stage-0 project folder
    cd hng-stage-1

    # install dependencies
    composer install

    # Seed the database
    php artisan migrate:fresh --seed

    # run the project
    php artisan serve

    # visit the endpoint
    https://localhost:8000/api/countries

```

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

-   [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
-   [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
-   Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
-   Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
-   Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
-   [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
-   [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.
